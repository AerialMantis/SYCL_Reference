# By re-using the public directory from previous runs, we can publish
# multiple branches in gitlab pages. Each branch is copied to a unique
# directory and will be included when we publish the public directory
# to gitlab pages.
#
# Results may be unpredictable because admin can purge cache and
# concurrent builds may over-write each other.
