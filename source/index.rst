SYCL Reference
==============

Welcome to the SYCL Reference! The reference is intended to be a handy
reference when writing SYCL programs for looking up SYCL classes,
member functions, their arguments, etc. It supplements the `SYCL
Specification`_ and has the same overall structure.

This document is a work-in-progress, and we are publishing now with
the hope that the community will make it better. We want to have a
document that is up-to-date and accurate, with many usage examples. If
you see something wrong, something that could be better, or want to
contribute an examples or descriptions, feel free to use the buttons at
the top right to file an issue on github or suggest an edit.
